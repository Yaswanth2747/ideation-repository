# Machine Learning Based Compression with Metadata Correction

## Overview

This idea explores a new approach to document compression. A shared machine learning model is used for compression and decompression, with an additional verification step to ensure that the reconstructed file matches the original. If any difference is detected, metadata is added to correct the result.

## Method

1. A shared ML model is used to compress a document into a smaller form.
2. The sender uses their local model to reconstruct the compressed file and checks for any errors.
3. If there is a difference between the original and the reconstructed file, helper metadata is added.
4. The compressed file and metadata are sent to the receiver.
5. The receiver uses the same model and metadata to perfectly reconstruct the original file.

## Motivation

- Traditional ML-based compressors often lose information and are used mainly for images and audio.
- Classical compressors are more reliable but do not learn patterns from data.
- This approach combines both, aiming to keep compression effective and reconstruction accurate.

## Research Questions

- What architecture is most suitable for this task: transformer or autoencoder?
- How should the metadata be designed to make reconstruction reliable?
- Can this method be extended to other formats such as JSON or structured logs?
- How does it compare with classical methods in terms of accuracy and compression ratio?

## Next Steps

- Prototype the system using a small pretrained model.
- Design and test the metadata generation mechanism.
- Run benchmarks against standard compression tools.
