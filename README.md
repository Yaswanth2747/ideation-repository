# Ideation Repository â€“ Yaswanth Ram Kumar

This repository contains technical ideas and early-stage concepts that I am currently exploring. These ideas are in various stages of development and reflect areas I am interested in, including digital hardware design and machine learning-based compression.

I believe, as one scientist put it, "Ideas are cheap, implementation is what matters." This repository is an attempt to move from thought to execution, and to share the process openly.

If you find any of these ideas interesting and would like to collaborate or discuss further, feel free to reach out.

## Ideas

### 1. [Columnwise Popcount Multiplier](./idea-01-columnwise-multiplier/)

This is a hardware design idea for a multiplier that avoids the traditional shift and add or Wallace tree structure. Instead, it counts how many bit-wise operations contribute to each output bit and computes the result using simple counting and carry logic.

### 2. [Machine Learning Based Compression with Metadata Correction](./idea-02-ml-compression-metadata/)

This idea combines shared machine learning models and classical metadata techniques to perform document compression in a way that ensures accurate reconstruction. It explores the use of a local verification step and conditional metadata generation.
